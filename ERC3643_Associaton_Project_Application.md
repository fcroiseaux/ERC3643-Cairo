# ERC3643 Association Project Initiation Application
__Initiator: Fabrice CROISEAUX__

## Process
__Application__: The initiator needs to fill out the application documents to provide project  details for the board members to review
__Approval__: The board will approve or deny the project to ensure quality
__Publication and call for contribution:__ the association will publish the project on the member platform and create news to share with all members to call for contribution
__Drive the project:__ The initiator will have full ownership as the lead and contact of the project.
The initiator will approve who to accept or deny if you don't think it is not relevant (association admin will assist you on this) 
The initiator will be responsible for driving the project from beginning to end by setting up a clear roadmap with assigned ownership to your co-contributors and conducting meetings to ensure the project progresses.  
Result communication: When the project is completed, the association will help to communicate the results.

## Project Name: ERC3643 on StarkNet: T-REX Token Standard Implementation
## Project Overview:
This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the ERC3643 T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) standard on StarkNet, the first implementation of this standard on a non-EVM Layer 2 solution. While implementations exist on EVM-compatible L2s like Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum, this project breaks new ground by bringing T-REX to StarkNet's Cairo-based ecosystem. The implementation leverages Cairo, StarkNet's native programming language, and integrates with OpenZeppelin's security-focused libraries to create a fully compliant solution.
One of the key innovations of this project is enabling the possession of regulated Security Tokens in Argent wallet - the first self-custodial wallet linked to a credit card. This integration creates a groundbreaking opportunity for retail investors to easily access regulated security tokens through a seamless user experience, potentially expanding the market for tokenized securities to a much wider audience.
This implementation addresses the critical need for secure, scalable, and regulatory-compliant tokenization infrastructure in the StarkNet ecosystem, expanding T-REX's functionality beyond EVM chains and enhancing the overall tokenization landscape.
## Goals of the Project:
- Create a production-ready implementation of ERC3643 (T-REX) on StarkNet
- Leverage StarkNet's scalability and lower transaction costs for regulated token issuance
- Integrate with Argent wallet to enable mainstream access to regulated security tokens through a credit card-linked self-custodial wallet
- Expand the ERC3643 ecosystem to non-EVM Layer 2 solutions
- Develop a cross-chain bridge between this StarkNet implementation and existing EVM-based implementations (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- Showcase interoperability between different blockchain architectures for regulated tokenization
- Develop a reference implementation that can be used by token issuers, financial institutions, and developers
- Establish a new standard for regulated tokens in the StarkNet ecosystem
- Create comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate adoption
## Current Status:
The project development has already started. The core components have been implemented, including:
- Token contract (ERC3643Token)
- Identity Registry
- Identity Storage
- Compliance
- Claim Topics Registry
- Trusted Issuers Registry
Recent work includes updating the implementation to be compatible with OpenZeppelin v2.0.0, which provides enhanced security features and improved interfaces. The project includes comprehensive test files and example implementations. The implementation is ready for review and further contributions to enhance specific features.
